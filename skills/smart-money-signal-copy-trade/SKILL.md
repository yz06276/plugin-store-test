## Disclaimer

**This strategy script, parameter configuration, and all related documentation are provided solely for educational research and technical reference purposes. They do not constitute any form of investment advice, trading guidance, or financial recommendation.**

1. **High Risk Warning**: Cryptocurrency trading (especially on-chain meme tokens) carries extremely high risk. Prices may fluctuate drastically or drop to zero within seconds. You may lose all invested capital.
2. **Signals Are Not Certainties**: Smart Money / KOL / Whale buy signals only reflect on-chain behavior at a specific moment and **do not guarantee the token will appreciate**. Signal sources may have delays, misjudgments, or manipulation. Smart money address labels come from third-party data sources, and their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
3. **Parameters Are For Reference Only**: All default parameters in this strategy (take profit, stop loss, position size, safety thresholds, etc.) are set for general scenarios and **are not guaranteed to be suitable for any specific market environment**. Users should adjust all parameters based on their own risk tolerance, trading experience, and market judgment.
4. **User Customization Encouraged**: Users are encouraged to deeply understand the meaning of each parameter and modify them according to their own strategy logic and risk preferences. Every parameter in `config.py` is annotated with comments for easy customization.
5. **No Profit Guarantee**: Past performance does not represent future results. Even parameters that perform well in backtesting may fail in live trading due to changing market conditions.
6. **Technical Risk**: On-chain transactions are irreversible. Smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities. Network congestion may cause transaction delays or failures.
7. **Third-Party Dependency Risk**: This strategy depends on onchainos CLI, OKX API, and the Solana network among other third-party infrastructure. Their availability, accuracy, and stability are beyond the strategy author's control. Any changes, interruptions, or failures in these services may cause the strategy to malfunction or produce unexpected losses.
8. **Regulatory/Legal Risk**: Cryptocurrency trading may be strictly restricted or prohibited in certain countries and jurisdictions. Users should independently verify and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction before using this strategy.
9. **Tax Risk**: Frequent trading may generate numerous taxable events. Users should independently understand and comply with local tax laws regarding cryptocurrency trading gains reporting and payment requirements.
10. **Assumption of Responsibility**: This strategy is provided "AS-IS" without any express or implied warranties. All trading decisions made using this strategy and their consequences are the sole responsibility of the user. The strategy authors, developers, distributors, and their affiliates are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or special losses.

**Recommendation**: For first-time use, run in Paper Mode (`DRY_RUN = True`). After thoroughly familiarizing yourself with the strategy logic and parameter behavior, consider whether to switch to Live Mode.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install onchainos CLI (>= 2.0.0-beta)

```bash
# Check if already installed
onchainos --version

# If not installed, follow onchainos official documentation
# Ensure onchainos is in PATH or located at ~/.local/bin/onchainos
```

### 2. Log in to Agentic Wallet (TEE Signing)

```bash
# One-time login (email verification)
onchainos wallet login <your-email>

# Verify login status
onchainos wallet status
# → loggedIn: true

# Confirm Solana address
onchainos wallet addresses --chain 501
```

> Agentic Wallet uses TEE secure enclave signing. Private keys are never exposed to code/logs/network.
> No need to set the WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable.

### 3. No pip install Required

This strategy only depends on the Python standard library + onchainos CLI. No third-party packages are needed.

---

## AI Agent Startup Interaction Protocol

> **When a user requests to start this strategy, the AI Agent must follow the procedure below. Do not skip directly to launch.**

### Phase 1: Present Strategy Overview

Show the user the following:

```
📡 Smart Money Signal Copy Trade v1.0 — Smart Money Signal Tracker

This strategy polls OKX Smart Money / KOL / Whale buy signals every 20 seconds.
When ≥3 smart wallets simultaneously buy the same token, it auto-buys after passing 15 safety filters.
A 7-layer exit system manages take profit and stop loss (Cost-Aware TP + Trailing + Time-Decay SL).

🧪 Current: Paper Mode — no real money spent, just observing signals

⚠️ Risk Notice: On-chain trading is high risk. You may lose all invested capital.

Default parameters (for reference only, adjust based on your situation):
  Position size:    high 0.020 / mid 0.015 / low 0.010 SOL
  Max positions:    6
  Min co-riders:    3 smart wallets
  Safety thresholds: MC≥$200K, Liq≥$80K, Holders≥300, Dev Rug=0
  Take Profit:      TP1 +5% / TP2 +15% / TP3 +30% (NET, cost-aware)
  Stop Loss:        -10% hard stop loss, tightens with time decay
  Trailing Stop:    Activates at +12% profit, exits on 10% drawdown
  Max hold time:    4 hours

All parameters can be freely modified in config.py to suit your trading style.
```

### Q1: Risk Preference (Mandatory)

- 🛡️ Conservative: Small positions, tight stop loss, fewer positions
- ⚖️ Default: Balanced configuration (recommended)
- 🔥 Aggressive: Large positions, wide stop loss, more positions

→ Parameter mapping (for AI Agent to write to config.py, not shown to user):

| Preference | SL_MULTIPLIER | MAX_POSITIONS | MIN_WALLET_COUNT | TIME_STOP_MAX_HOLD_HRS | TRAIL_ACTIVATE | TRAIL_DISTANCE |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 0.92 (-8%) | 4 | 5 | 2 | 0.08 | 0.06 |
| Default | 0.90 (-10%) | 6 | 3 | 4 | 0.12 | 0.10 |
| Aggressive | 0.85 (-15%) | 8 | 3 | 6 | 0.18 | 0.12 |

### Q2: Switch to Live Trading?

- A. 🧪 Stay in Paper Mode, launch directly (recommended default)
- B. 💰 Switch to Live Mode

**Option A** → Proceed directly to launch steps.

**Option B** → Enter Live Mode sub-flow:

1. ⚠️ Confirm with user:
   "Live Mode will use real SOL for trading. Losses are irreversible. Confirm switch to Live Mode?"
   - User confirms → Continue
   - User declines → Fall back to Paper Mode

2. Ask for total budget in SOL (range 0.5-10, default 1.0 SOL)

3. AI auto-calculates (let B = user's budget input):
   - `SESSION_STOP_SOL = B × 0.10` (stop at 10% loss)
   - `SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT_SOL = B × 0.05` (pause at 5% loss)
   - `POSITION_TIERS`:
     - `high: {"min_addr": 8, "sol": max(0.020 × B, 0.005)}`
     - `mid:  {"min_addr": 5, "sol": max(0.015 × B, 0.005)}`
     - `low:  {"min_addr": 3, "sol": max(0.010 × B, 0.005)}`

4. Show calculated results to user and confirm:
   "Your Live Mode config: Total budget X SOL, per-trade high/mid/low = Y/Y/Y SOL, loss stop limit Z SOL. Confirm?"
   - User confirms → Write to config.py
   - User requests adjustments → Return to step 2

5. Set mode parameters:
   - `DRY_RUN = False`
   - `PAUSED = False`

### Launch

1. Modify corresponding parameters in `config.py` based on user responses
2. Set `PAUSED = False` (allow bot to run normally after interaction confirmation)
3. Check prerequisites: `onchainos --version`, `onchainos wallet status`
4. Start bot: `python3 bot.py`
5. Show Dashboard link: `http://localhost:3248`
6. Inform user: Currently in Paper Mode. To switch to Live Mode, change `DRY_RUN = False` in `config.py`

If user says "use default config" or "just run it", only set `PAUSED = False`, leave everything else unchanged, and launch in Paper Mode.

### Special Cases

- User explicitly says "don't ask me, just run" → Launch with default parameters (Paper Mode), but must show Phase 1 overview + set `PAUSED = False`
- User is a returning user (config history exists in conversation) → Remind of previous config, ask whether to reuse

---

## Quick Start

> ⚠️ Before launching, confirm the `DRY_RUN` value in config.py — `True` for Paper, `False` for Live.

```bash
cd ~/CC/Smart\ Money\ Signal\ Copy\ Trade\ -\ 聪明钱信号跟单

# 1. Confirm onchainos is logged in
onchainos wallet status

# 2. Start bot (foreground, Ctrl+C to stop)
python3 bot.py

# 3. Open Dashboard
open http://localhost:3248

# 4. Stop
pkill -f bot.py
```

> **First launch defaults to PAUSED=True, no new positions will be opened. After confirming everything is normal, change config.py PAUSED=False.**
> config.py supports hot-reload (`importlib.reload`). No bot restart needed after changes.

---

## Parameter Tuning

**All adjustable parameters are in `config.py`** — no need to modify `bot.py`.

### Common Adjustments

| Need | Modify in `config.py` |
|---|---|
| Pause/Resume trading | `PAUSED = True/False` |
| Paper/Live Mode switch | `DRY_RUN = True/False` |
| Adjust position size | `sol` values in `POSITION_TIERS` for each tier |
| Adjust max positions | `MAX_POSITIONS = 6` |
| Adjust min co-rider count | `MIN_WALLET_COUNT = 3` |
| Adjust take profit | `pct` and `sell` in `TP_TIERS` |
| Adjust hard stop loss | `SL_MULTIPLIER = 0.90` (-10%) |
| Adjust time-decay SL | `TIME_DECAY_SL` list |
| Adjust trailing stop | `TRAIL_ACTIVATE = 0.12`, `TRAIL_DISTANCE = 0.10` |
| Adjust max hold time | `TIME_STOP_MAX_HOLD_HRS = 4` |
| MC range | `MIN_MCAP = 200_000`, `MIN_LIQUIDITY = 80_000` |
| Session loss limits | `SESSION_STOP_SOL = 0.10`, `SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT_SOL = 0.05` |
| Scan interval | `POLL_INTERVAL_SEC = 20` |
| Dashboard port | `DASHBOARD_PORT = 3248` |

Changes take effect automatically via hot-reload (no bot restart needed).

**Scheduled Tasks:**

| Task | Frequency | Responsibility |
|------|------|------|
| `run()` | Every 20s | Poll signals → Pre-filter → Deep verification → Buy |
| `monitor_positions()` | Every 20s | Fetch position prices → 7-layer exit system |
| `importlib.reload(config)` | Auto each cycle | Hot-reload config.py parameters |

---

## Safety Checks

### Level 1 Pre-filter (2 checks, based on signal list data, 0 extra API calls)

| # | Check | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Smart Money sell ratio | `soldRatioPercent` < 80% |
| 2 | Co-rider wallet count | `triggerWalletCount` >= 3 |

### Level 2 Deep Verification (13 checks, via onchainos CLI)

| # | Check | Threshold | Data Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Market Cap | >= $200,000 | `market prices` |
| 2 | Liquidity | >= $80,000 | `market prices` |
| 3 | Holder count | >= 300 | `market prices` |
| 4 | Liquidity/MC ratio | >= 5% | `market prices` |
| 5 | Top10 concentration | <= 50% | `token advanced-info` |
| 6 | Holder density | >= 50 per million MC | `market prices` |
| 7 | K1 price change | <= 15% | `market candles` |
| 8 | Dev rug history | = 0 (zero tolerance) | `token advanced-info` |
| 9 | Dev farm | <= 20 | `token advanced-info` |
| 10 | Dev holding | <= 15% | `token advanced-info` |
| 11 | Bundler ATH | <= 25% | `token advanced-info` |
| 12 | Bundler count | <= 5 | `token advanced-info` |
| 13 | LP burn | >= 80% | `token advanced-info` |

### Final Pre-Buy Check

- SOL balance >= position size + `SOL_GAS_RESERVE` (0.05)
- Honeypot detection: `isHoneyPot == false && taxRate <= 5` (via `swap quote`)
- Position count < `MAX_POSITIONS`
- Not in cooldown / Session not paused/stopped

---

## Position Tiers

| Tier | Condition | Position |
|---|---|---|
| **high** | >= 8 co-rider wallets | 0.020 SOL |
| **mid** | >= 5 co-rider wallets | 0.015 SOL |
| **low** | >= 3 co-rider wallets | 0.010 SOL |

**Cost Model (Breakeven by tier):**

| Tier | Fixed Cost Ratio | Slippage Cost (x2 legs) | Breakeven |
|---|---|---|---|
| high (0.020) | 0.001/0.020 = 5.0% | 2.0% | **7.0%** |
| mid (0.015) | 0.001/0.015 = 6.7% | 2.0% | **8.7%** |
| low (0.010) | 0.001/0.010 = 10.0% | 2.0% | **12.0%** |

> TP is **cost-aware** — `tp_threshold = net_target + breakeven_pct`. For the low tier, TP1 actually requires +17% raw price change to trigger (5% + 12% breakeven).

---

## 7-Layer Exit System

| Priority | Exit Type | Trigger Condition | Sell Ratio |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **EXIT 0** | Liquidity emergency exit | `liq < $5,000` | 100% |
| **EXIT 1** | Dust cleanup | Position value < $0.10 | 100% |
| **EXIT 2** | Hard stop loss | `price <= entry × 0.90` (-10%) | 100% |
| **EXIT 3** | Time-decay SL | 30min: -8%, 60min: -5% | 100% |
| **EXIT 4** | Tiered take profit | TP1 +5% NET sell 30% / TP2 +15% sell 40% / TP3 +30% sell 100% | Partial |
| **EXIT 5** | Trailing stop | Peak PnL >= +12%, then drawdown >= 10% from peak | 100% |
| **EXIT 6** | Trend time stop | Position >= 30min and 15m candle reversal confirmed | 100% |
| **EXIT 7** | Hard time stop | Hold time >= 4h | 100% |

---

## Session Risk Control

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Consecutive loss pause | 3 times → Pause 10min (`MAX_CONSEC_LOSS = 3`) |
| Cumulative loss pause | >= 0.05 SOL → Pause 30min (`SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT_SOL = 0.05`) |
| Cumulative loss stop | >= 0.10 SOL → Stop trading (`SESSION_STOP_SOL = 0.10`) |
| Max hold time | 4h (`TIME_STOP_MAX_HOLD_HRS = 4`) |

Consecutive loss counter resets on a profitable trade. Session risk control auto-resets on bot restart.

---

## Iron Rules (Must Not Be Violated)

1. `advanced-info` safety check failure → Fail-Closed, **do not buy**.
2. `soldRatioPercent > 80%` skip — Smart money is already selling, don't catch the falling knife.
3. K1 price change > 15% skip — Don't chase pumps.
4. Zero tolerance for Dev rug history — If there's a rug, don't buy.
5. After selling a token, set cooldown. **No re-buying** during cooldown period.
6. Position size is fixed per tier. **No adding to positions**.
7. If all three levels of buy price fallback fail (price <= 0), **do not open position**.
8. Daily loss limit reached → Stop all buying.
9. `SOL_GAS_RESERVE` 0.05 SOL is never spent on trades.
10. **Must** hold `state_lock` before writing to positions.json.

| 11 | `onchainos wallet history --tx-hash <hash> --chain-index 501` | Transaction confirmation |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| "FATAL: onchainos CLI not found" | Install onchainos and ensure it is in PATH |
| "No Solana address" | Run `onchainos wallet login <email>` to complete login |
| Login expired | Re-run `onchainos wallet login <email>` |
| Dashboard won't open | Check if port 3248 is in use: `lsof -i:3248` |
| Bot starts but doesn't trade | Check `PAUSED = True`, change to `False` (hot-reload, no restart needed) |
| Lots of SKIP in Feed | Signal tokens didn't pass pre-filter (MC/Liq/soldRatio), this is normal |
| Lots of SAFETY_REJECT in Feed | Deep verification blocked, adjust config based on rejection reason (DevRug/Bundler/K1) |
| `No signals` keeps appearing | No smart money buy signals currently, normal behavior — just wait |
| Live mode buy failure | Check SOL balance >= position + 0.05; confirm wallet is logged in |
| `InstructionError Custom:1` | `swap --from` must use native SOL `11111111111111111111111111111111`, not WSOL |
| SESSION_PAUSE, not trading | Session risk control triggered, wait for pause to end or adjust `SESSION_LOSS_LIMIT_SOL` |
| SESSION_STOP | Cumulative loss reached limit, restart bot to reset session |
| PnL display abnormal | Check `entry_price` field in `positions.json` for value of 0 |
| Config change not taking effect | No restart needed — `importlib.reload(config)` auto hot-reloads each cycle |

### Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Wrong Approach | Correct Approach |
|---|---|---|
| TP not profitable | TP uses raw pct | `tp_threshold = pct×100 + breakeven_pct` |
| Ignoring costs | TP at 8% and sell | NET 5% actual trigger = 5%+12% = 17% raw gain (low tier) |
| dev rug | Don't check dev | `onchainos token advanced-info` zero tolerance |
| Continuous losses without stopping | Keep trading | 3 consecutive losses pause / 0.10 SOL stop |
| swap --from uses WSOL | `So11111...112` | **Must use native SOL `1111...1111` (32 ones)** |
| contract-call --to | Pass token address | **Must pass swap response's `tx.to` (DEX router address)** |
| swap amount unit | Pass UI units | `swap quote/swap` `--amount` uses **lamports** (1 SOL = 1e9) |
| wallet balance get SOL | Get WSOL balance | Get entry where `tokenAddress === ''` = native SOL |
